# stacks-name-system
BNS powered by Ryder

This is built on top of the blockchain name system (BNS) on the [Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.co). It allows entities to create 
namespaces where name registrations are controlled by the entity.

This project contains smart contracts in folder `backend-public` and a UI built with React for testing in folder `frontend-dev`.
